# PostgreSQL local Setup
## Leigh, 15/09/2021


Please note: this guide was writted for WSL systems (Linux, on a windows machine)

1. Delete any versions of PostgreSQL you may have 
(I had a windows version and a WSL verion, I had to remove windows version to make WSL version work)
2. In bash, run $ sudo apt-get update
3. In bash, run $ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

4. In bash, run "$ ls /etc/postgresql", to determine the version number
5. In bash, run "$ls /etc/postgresql/VERSION_NUMBER/main" to access config files
(not necessary, but can help trouble shooting later,)
(This command is done just to verify install.)
(Files should include :"conf.d", "environment", "pg_ctl.conf", "pg_hba.conf", 
"pg_ident.conf", "postgresql.conf" and "start.conf")

6.  In bash, run "$ service postgresql", to see command options
7.  In bash, run "$ service postgresql status", to see server status
8.  If server is down, run "$ service postgresql status" 
9. (For this project, the local DB password needs to be set to 123456, 
the helpful video below shows how to do this)

Server should be set up and running

# TODO
I don't think the DB is fully setup yet, the link below could prove handy

# Helpful Tips

## Changing Port of Postgre Server
 1. In bash, run "$ls /etc/postgresql/VERSION_NUMBER/main" to access config files
 2. open "postgresql.conf" with a text editor
 3. scroll to line 64
 4. edit port variable to port of your choice
 5. save file
 6. exit editor
 7. restart Server

 (For good luck, restart machine between steps 6 and 7)
